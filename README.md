# Snake-Game
This is a personal project for learning pygame. This is done without any step-by-step tutorials as to test my knowledge on pygame.

## Libraries
Pygame, sys, random

## Contribution
Finding bugs or logical errors and letting me know through an issue is one way to help with the project. For the code however, I will most likely do it myself.
